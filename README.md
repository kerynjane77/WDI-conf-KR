##WDIconf website

A single page site for WDI Conference, with sections about the location, speakers and talks, program, and a registration form (which triggers a 'thankyou' modal). I made a fixed nav in the top corner to make the site more responsive.

### Tech

Made using HTML5, CSS3 and javaScript. JQuery was used to make scrolling smooth between sections, and for the modal. I made the logo and images in Adobe Illustrator and saved them as .svg files so they could be resized without losing resolution.
